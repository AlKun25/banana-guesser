# Redis Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

Your application has been successfully migrated from JSON file storage to Redis using Upstash Redis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `@upstash/redis` - Redis client for Upstash

### 2. Files Modified
- **`src/lib/data.ts`** - Complete rewrite to use Redis operations
- **`src/lib/challenge-utils.ts`** - New utility file for challenge sanitization
- **`src/app/challenge/[id]/page.tsx`** - Updated imports and removed duplicate function
- **`src/app/api/challenges/[id]/route.ts`** - Updated imports
- **`src/app/api/challenges/route.ts`** - Updated imports
- **`package.json`** - Added migration script

### 3. New Files Created
- **`scripts/migrate-to-redis.js`** - Migration script to transfer existing data
- **`REDIS_MIGRATION.md`** - Detailed setup and migration guide
- **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Redis Database
1. Create an Upstash Redis database at [console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com/)
2. Choose "Global" type for best performance
3. Copy your REST API credentials

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with your Redis credentials:
```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token-here
```

### 3. Migrate Your Data
Run the migration script to transfer existing JSON data:
```bash
pnpm run migrate-to-redis
```

### 4. Test the Application
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Data Structure

Redis stores data with these keys:
- `challenges` - All challenge data
- `purchases` - All purchase records  
- `users` - All user wallet data

## API Compatibility

✅ All existing API endpoints remain unchanged
✅ All function signatures are identical
✅ No breaking changes to client code

## Benefits

- **Performance**: In-memory Redis operations are much faster
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Built-in persistence and replication
- **Global**: Upstash provides worldwide edge locations

The migration is complete and your application will work exactly the same way, but with improved performance and scalability!
