/api/challenges/[id]/guess    # POST submit sentence guess
```

### Database Schema (JSON Files)

## MVP Scope (3-Hour Hackathon)

### Must Have
✅ Basic dashboard with challenge cards  
✅ Challenge creation (text input + image generation)  
✅ Word purchase flow  
✅ 20-second exclusive access timer  
✅ Basic sentence guessing  
✅ StackAuth integration  

### Nice to Have
⭐ Dynamic word pricing  
⭐ User wallet/earnings tracking  
⭐ Challenge difficulty ratings  
⭐ Sound effects for word reveals  

### Out of Scope
❌ Advanced image editing  
❌ Multi-language support  
❌ Complex user profiles  
❌ Challenge categories/tags  

## Data Models

### Challenge
```
{
  id: string
  sentence: string
  imageUrl: string
  words: Array<{
    text: string
    position: number
    isPurchased: boolean
    purchasedBy: string | null
    purchaseTime: Date | null
  }>
  createdBy: string
  solvedBy: string | null
  isActive: boolean
}
```

### User Purchase
```
{
  userId: string
  challengeId: string
  wordIndex: number
  purchaseTime: Date
  accessExpiresAt: Date
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Path
1. Set up Next.js project with StackAuth
2. Create basic dashboard UI
3. Implement image generation pipeline
4. Build word selection and payment flow
5. Add timer-based access control
6. Integrate sentence guessing logic

### Technical Considerations
- **Image Generation**: Cache generated images to avoid regeneration
- **Timer Sync**: Use server-side timestamps for accurate countdowns
- **Payment Flow**: Handle async payment confirmation
- **State Management**: Consider React Context for user purchases
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
